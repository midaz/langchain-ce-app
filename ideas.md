- Upload issues to web interface for CE agents to take next action
- POST response to github issue
- Add TS documentation and classification
- Make it a chatbot (add memory)


Prodict Improvements
- Splits and tags intuitively don't make sense. When I'm changing 20 variables, I want to see a consolidated view of analytics over the changes so I know what permutation performed best, recommendations for perms to try, etc 
- Unit testing for outputs (checkIF String exists as date)

Other Project Ideas: 
- slack community responder
